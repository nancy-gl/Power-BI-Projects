Example Power BI Projects

# Project 1: For the Optical Data Analysis;
This report allows to see the Optometric patients appointment details.
The next appointment due date based on the following logic -> 
Age under 25- require an eye exam once a year, 
Age 25 upto and including 55- once every 6 months, 
Age greater than 55- should be having an appointment once every 3 months. 
Also created an indicator or status to see which patients were due for appointments,
the change in their eye measurements from last appointment.

# Project 2: For Supplier Analysis;
The task was to find which vendors/plants are causing greatest defect quality and greatest downtime.
Here I learned to find top N best/worst category, using What If parameters. Also explored the
new smart narrative feature. And implemented Bookmarks for layering visuals. Learnt the ease/difficulties
of using page navigation and bookmarks.

# Project 3: For Insurance Complain Analysis;
The ask is to see status changes and when it happened, the complaints broken down by the dimension and also to figure out the client satisfaction.
Need work for broker analysis.
Here, I learned to make a fly over filter pane that would help save visualization space.

# Project 4: For Accounts AR Dataset; 
Cleaned the dataset that was really messy and prepared the aging report.
This was a Power Query excercise as the source data had to be cleaned. 
Created the invoice aging report using waterfall chart.
