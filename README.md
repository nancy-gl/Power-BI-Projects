Example Power BI Projects

# [Project 1: For the Optical Data Analysis](https://github.com/nancy-gl/Optical_patients_report)
* This report allows to see the Optometric patients appointment details.
* The next appointment due date based on the following logic -> 
  1. Age under 25- require an eye exam once a year,
  2. Age 25 upto and including 55- once every 6 months,
  3. Age greater than 55- should be having an appointment once every 3 months.
* Also created an indicator or status to see which patients were due for appointments, the change in their eye measurements from last appointment.

# [Project 2: For Supplier Analysis](https://github.com/nancy-gl/Reports)
* The task was to find which vendors/plants are causing greatest defect quality and greatest downtime.
* I performed top N analysis (best/worst category), using What If parameters.
* Also explored the new smart narrative feature to use dynamic measure value.
* Implemented Bookmarks for layering visuals to give a different perspective.

# [Project 3: For Insurance Complain Analysis](https://github.com/nancy-gl/Reports)
* The ask is to see status changes and when it happened, the complaints broken down by the dimension and also to figure out the client satisfaction.
* Made use of bookmarks to get fly over filter pane that would help save visualization space.

# [Project 4: For Accounts AR Dataset](https://github.com/nancy-gl/Reports)
* Performed ETL to clean the dataset that was really messy.
* Used Power Query for the transformations. 
* Created the invoice aging report using waterfall chart.
